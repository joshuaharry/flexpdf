# FlexPDF

A flexible collection of design patterns and UI components designed to make layering sophisticated functionality atop PDF documents easy.

## Getting Started

To use this code in your project, you will need to add the peer dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. You will also need to install the Adobe Embed API in order to render PDF documents; consult [this documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/document-services/apis/pdf-embed/) for more details.

## Work in Progress

We are currently in the pre-alpha stage of development. Further updates in the weeks ahead are to come.
